# Yim
This repository is collection of my Neovim file configs so it's easier for me to to switch editors and computers.

## Motivation
> Keep in mind this is my personal opinion and I am not a tool elitist. As long as you personally don't have to fight your tools and get actual work done, use whatever you want.
I decided to take my vim journey more seriously after realizing how slow I was moving with other IDEs such as Visual Studio and Xcode. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against these IDEs, they are very sufisticated and if you know what you are doing, you can be very fast in them. 

One tool that I am on the fence about is VSCode. I want to love it and master it but sometimes it either feels like too much or too little. Idk if anyone has faced this but when using the formatters, it sometimes tries to use the Prettier formatter (`Javascript ES6`) when I am writing C/C++ code (should be using `clang`). There is definitely a fix this and this is a nitpicky complaint.

VSCode does feel like a text editor optimized for writing Web and Python applications, but seems to fall short for other environments where system languages like C, C++, and Rust are used.

## Tools
Among the tools I use are:
* MacOS
    * iTerm2
The reason for iTerm2 is that the base macOS terminal only supports 8-bit colors, so all the colors and themes that come with NvChad come out to be messed up.
* Windows
    * Terminal (Microsoft)
    * Ubuntu WSL
* Linux
    * Ubuntu built in terminal

## Plugins
- NvChad
Using NvChad for now to help give me a good base and turn Neovim into a full IDE. As I get more comfortable, I will start to know which plugins I need and which ones work for me. So far the UI plugins seem to suffice and already make using Neovim a pleasant expereince.
